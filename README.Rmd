Files

        Code_Book.md is the file that describes the variables, the data, and the transformations to clean up the            data.

        run_analysis.R is the script reposnsible for data preparation, as described bellow:
                1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
                2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
                3) Names activities, using comprehensive names;
                4) Renames labels in the data set with descriptive variable names;
                5) Creates a second tidy data set with the average of each variable in activity and subject.
                
        Final_Set.txt is the exported final data after generated by the run_analysis.R script.
